Simplest way to translate CK3 localization

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Put the API key in the .env file
4. Put localization folder into loc folder
5. Configure target language in src/index.ts (default is Turkish)
6. Run `npm run start`


Note: Marked rows will not be translated such as `# Translated!`

You can also check non required other tools like merge-translated-yml and yml-translate-pointer. These are optional tools for my development.
